- Immersive gameplay that blends in with your desktop!
- Awesome music!
- More "accurate" failure (bluescreens your computer)
- Only runs on Windows (sorry)
Enjoy this wonderful experience!

- Open its folder and launch a console
- Run `python3 main.py`
- Profit (don't lose)
# Don't play this game with unsaved work! It WILL crash your computer if you lose.
It's just part of the experience.
