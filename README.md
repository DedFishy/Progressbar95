# Progressbar95 Real Edition
Progressbar95 is a pretty fun game with a lot of effort put into it and some decent gameplay. However, as I'm sure everyone who's played will concur, it doesn't have enough realism! You're bound to the constraints of the game's window, and when you fail, you can just restart really quickly! That's why we now have Progressbar95 Real Edition.
- Immersive gameplay that blends in with your desktop!
- Awesome music!
- More "accurate" failure!
- Only runs on Windows because of this: ![image](https://github.com/DedFishy/Progressbar95/assets/54646090/776f78e3-096f-40ac-9911-11afc98ddb00)
Enjoy this wonderful experience!
